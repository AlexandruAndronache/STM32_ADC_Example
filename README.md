# STM32_ADC_Example


 
This project showcases the NUCLEO-F446RE ADC module.

Project description: 
Pin PA0 is set up as an analog input.
Multiple buttons and resistors form a voltage divider with the output tied to PA0.
Pressing different buttons outputs different voltage levels to PA0 allowing to identify which button has been pressed.
